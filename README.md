# Project Name: HorseRacing
### Author: Hans-MÃ¤rten Liiu

Main Idea:
-------------

* Users are able to create a race (place and time)
* Users are able to enter horses participating in (name color)
* All horses entered are also stored in the database
* You can bet only on one horse
* Horse race: system computes race results with a random function.
* The system shows the user race results: the user wins upon picking the winner horse and loses in all other circumstances.
* All race results will be saved to the database
* All race results can be browsed in the UI
* At least some of the application is covered by tests
* Application is deployed (to heroku, aws etc)

## Application functional details:
* Backend deployed at heroku: https://backend-horseracing.herokuapp.com/
* You can see horserace listings
* You can add a race
* You can add horses to a race
* You can see race's detailed view
* You can bet on race
* You can see if you won or not on race's detailedview


</br>

## What can be done next:
* Maybe make a currency system, so users can actually win or lose currency
* Add amount how much you would like to bet
* Flexible design
* User profiles

</br>

## How to boot the application(no point, because the application is deployed):
* Open up cmd and cd into backend-node folder and then npm start
* Open up another cmd and cd into horserace-front-end folder and then npm install. After packages are installed you can npm start and the application will pop up.

## Images of the application
* coming soon
