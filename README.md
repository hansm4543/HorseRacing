Main Idea:
-------------

Users are able to create a race (place and time)
Users are able to enter horses participating in (name color)
All horses entered are also stored in the database
You can bet only on one horse
Horse race: system computes race results with a random function.
The system shows the user race results: the user wins upon picking the winner horse and loses in all other circumstances.
All race results will be saved to the database
All race results can be browsed in the UI
At least some of the application is covered by tests
Application is deployed (to heroku, aws etc)
